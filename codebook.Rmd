#### **Instructions for project**
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected. 

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

#### Get the data
1. **Download the file and name file as UCI_HAR_Final.zip**
```{r}
library(dplyr)
filename <- "UCI_HAR_Final.zip"

if (!file.exists(filename)){
fileURL <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip"

download.file(fileURL,filename, method="curl")
}
```
2.**Unzip the file** 
```{r}
if (!file.exists("UCI HAR Dataset")) { 
  unzip(filename) 
}
```

3.**unzipped files are in the folder`UCI HAR Dataset`. Get the list of the files**
```{r}
path_rf <- file.path("UCI HAR Dataset")
files<-list.files(path_rf, recursive=TRUE)
files
```
#### Read data from  the  targeted files

**Get the big picture of the structure of the data frame that will be used in this project.**

the picture below comes from the picture post on forum by `Community TA  David Hood`.

From the picture and the related files, we can see:

1. Values of Varible `Activity` consist of  data from  "Y_train.txt" and  "Y_test.txt"   
2. values of Varible `Subject` consist of  data from "subject_train.txt" and  subject_test.txt" 
3. Values of Varibles `Features` consist of  data from "X_train.txt" and  "X_test.txt" 
4. Names of Varibles `Features` come from "features.txt"
5. levels of Varible `Activity` come from "activity_labels.txt"

So we will use  `Activity`, `Subject` and `Features` as part of descriptive variable names for data in data frame. 

**Read data from the files into the variables**

Read the Activity files
```{r}
activities <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt", col.names = c("code", "activity"))
y_test  <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/test/y_test.txt", col.names = "code")
y_train <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt", col.names = "code")
```

Read the Subject files
```{r}
subject_train <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt", col.names = "subject")
subject_test <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt", col.names = "subject")
```

Read Features files
```{r}
features <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt", col.names = c("n","functions"))
x_test <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt", col.names = features$functions)
x_train <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt", col.names = features$functions)
```

**Look at  the properties of the above varibles** 

```{r}
str(y_test)
str(y_train)
str(subject_train)
str(subject_test)
str(x_test)
str(x_train)
```

#### Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set

```{r}
X <- rbind(x_train, x_test)
Y <- rbind(y_train, y_test)
Subject <- rbind(subject_train, subject_test)
Merged_Data <- cbind(Subject, Y, X)
```

#### Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

```{r}
TidyData <- Merged_Data %>% select(subject, code, contains("mean"), contains("std"))
str(TidyData)
```

#### Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
```{r}
TidyData$code <- activities[TidyData$code, 2]
```

#### Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
```{r}
names(TidyData)[2] = "activity"
names(TidyData)<-gsub("Acc", "Accelerometer", names(TidyData))
names(TidyData)<-gsub("Gyro", "Gyroscope", names(TidyData))
names(TidyData)<-gsub("BodyBody", "Body", names(TidyData))
names(TidyData)<-gsub("Mag", "Magnitude", names(TidyData))
names(TidyData)<-gsub("^t", "Time", names(TidyData))
names(TidyData)<-gsub("^f", "Frequency", names(TidyData))
names(TidyData)<-gsub("tBody", "TimeBody", names(TidyData))
names(TidyData)<-gsub("-mean()", "Mean", names(TidyData), ignore.case = TRUE)
names(TidyData)<-gsub("-std()", "STD", names(TidyData), ignore.case = TRUE)
names(TidyData)<-gsub("-freq()", "Frequency", names(TidyData), ignore.case = TRUE)
names(TidyData)<-gsub("angle", "Angle", names(TidyData))
names(TidyData)<-gsub("gravity", "Gravity", names(TidyData))
```

#### From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
```{r}
FinalData <- TidyData %>%
  group_by(subject, activity) %>%
  summarise_all(funs(mean))
write.table(FinalData, "FinalData.txt", row.name=FALSE)
```
